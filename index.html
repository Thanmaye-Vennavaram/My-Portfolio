        <p> Art is my favorite Hobby. I do art when I'm bored or on my free time. Whenever I am done my school homework or have nothing left to do, I do art. I am 11 years old and I have done art since I was 5 years old. When I make masterpieces it makes me feel like when I spend time on things the result will be perfect! Anyone could do art, it creates fun and let's our imagination come to life. In art, I mostly do steches, paintings, and color them when I'm done. It makes me calm and doesn't make me feel bored, every part gets better and more colorful!</p>
